Titanic Dashboard Project
This repository showcases the Titanic Dashboard, where I used Excel for data cleaning and visualization to analyze and present insights about the passengers of the Titanic.

Project Overview
The objective of this project is to:

Analyze the Titanic dataset to uncover key patterns and statistics.
Create a dashboard that provides a clear and interactive summary of the data.
Share meaningful insights related to survival rates, passenger demographics, and ticket classes.
Tools Used
Excel: For both data cleaning and building the dashboard, leveraging Excel's advanced visualization and analytical features.
Dataset Description
The dataset contains information about passengers aboard the Titanic, including:

Passenger Details: Name, age, gender, ticket class, fare, and more.
Survival Status: Whether each passenger survived or not.
Cabin and Embarkation Data: Details about passenger accommodations and boarding points.
Key Features of the Dashboard
Survival Analysis: Breakdown of survival rates by gender, age group, and ticket class.
Demographics Overview: Insights into passenger distribution by age, gender, and embarkation points.
Fare Analysis: Comparison of ticket fares across classes and survival status.
Interactive Filters: Slicers for filtering data by class, gender, and survival status.
Project Workflow
Data Cleaning in Excel:

Handled missing values (e.g., age and cabin details).
Standardized formatting for consistent data representation.
Created calculated fields (e.g., age groups, survival percentages).
Dashboard Creation in Excel:

Designed an interactive dashboard using pivot tables, slicers, and charts.
Included bar charts, pie charts, and stacked columns to present data effectively.
Enhanced visuals with conditional formatting for clear insights.
Insights and Recommendations
Gender and Survival: Women had a significantly higher survival rate than men.
Ticket Class and Survival: First-class passengers had the highest survival rates, highlighting a disparity.
Age and Survival: Children had a better chance of survival compared to adults.
Embarkation Trends: Majority of passengers boarded from Southampton, but survival rates varied by embarkation point.

How to Use
Download the Excel file from this repository.
Open the file to view the dashboard and interact with slicers for a detailed analysis.
Future Improvements
Expand the analysis by incorporating additional datasets (e.g., Titanic crew data).
Automate data cleaning using Python or Power Query.
Create advanced dashboards using Power BI for richer interactivity.
